# Template Routes

As of ExpressionEngine 2.8, there is a new core feature called Template Routes. To avoid confusion with this new core feature, this add-on has been renamed [Resource Router](https://github.com/rsanchez/resource_router), which has all the same features as Template Routes + a whole lot more. You'll find instructions for upgrading from Template Routes there.
